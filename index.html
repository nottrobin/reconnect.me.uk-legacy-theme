      <h1 id="mainheading">I offer friendly psychotherapy in aldermaston</h1>
      <p>I offer counselling and psychotherapy in Aldermaston, near Reading, Newbury and Basingstoke. I am experienced in both short-term and long-term work. I see individuals and couples and can also offer parent-child counselling.</p>
      
      <section id="method">
        <h1>Method</h1>
        <p>I use a broad-based, flexible and practical approach to therapy. Everyone has a unique set of questions, experiences strengths and concerns and so the way in which I help you to address your needs is individually based.</p>
        <p>In short-term work I often utilise some cognitive-behavioural methods, relaxation and stress relief approaches. Longer-term work can address deep-seated problems or more profound self-development.</p>
        <p>My general model is based on a sound understanding of the principles of child development, the effects of stress and trauma on the brain and psychological integration.</p>

        <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
        <p>Have you got any questions about psychotherapy? Here are answers to some of the most common questions. If you have any other questions don't hesitate to <a href="getintouch.html">get in touch</a>.</p>
        
        <article>
          <h1>Would I benefit from therapy?</h1>
          <p>If something is persistently or recurrently bothering you, the answer is probably ‘yes’.  There is good research evidence that most people who go to counselling or therapy  benefit.</p>
          <p>Therapy and counselling can help with a wide range of problems.  You may come with generalised anxiety or depressive symptoms, mood swings, a sense of lack of fulfilment or aliveness, or find yourself more reactive and angry than you like. You may have some addictive or other self-destructive habits.</p>
          <p>You may be concerned about interpersonal issues in a number of ways, suffering from a relationship breakdown or bereavement, or wanting relationship, marital or family counselling.</p>
        </article>
       
        <article>
          <h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
          <p>My normal full charge is £45 per hour although I am willing to negotiate for those unable to pay the full amount. I can also take clients through private health insurance and I am registered as a provider with Aviva.</p>
          <p>I invite highly paid clients to contribute to a bursary fund for those who have financial difficulties.</p>
        </article>
        
        <article>
          <h1>What will the first session be like?</h1>
          <p>At our initial meeting we will explore why you are seeking therapy and find out some background to your situation. This will give you an opportunity to find out how you feel about working with me and where you might want to go from here – you can ask any questions about how I work.</p>
          <p>The initial meeting is generally longer than your usual session because I like to allow time for an adequate assessment of your situation. I like to allow up to an hour and a half at my usual hourly fee.</p>
        </article>
        
        <article>
          <h1>What about further sessions?</h1>
          <p>Generally we make an initial contract for six sessions at our first meeting. After this time, if we are continuing, we will make an agreement for continuing work, either fixed-term or open-ended.</p>
          <p>Most clients have one hourly session with me per week, although I can be flexible about session length. I can also work with greater frequency e.g. twice a week maybe at the beginning in times of crisis or less frequency e.g. fortnightly when this is appropriate.</p>
        </article>
       
        <article>
          <h1>How much therapy might I need?</h1>
          <p>Typically, I find people who engage in long-term work might come for one to three years and those who are aiming to address a specific problem in short-term therapy for something like 6-12 weeks. This can vary enormously with some people requiring just a few sessions while others can stay for years.</p>
          <p>It is difficult to answer this question on an individual basis, although we may arrive at an educated guess at an initial meeting.</p>
        </article>
      
        <article>
          <h1>What is the difference between counselling and psychotherapy?</h1>
          <p>Counselling and psychotherapy merge into each other. The word counselling tends to be used for shorter-term work often focused on particular problems, and the psychotherapy for more ongoing, in depth work, looking at personality issues.</p>
