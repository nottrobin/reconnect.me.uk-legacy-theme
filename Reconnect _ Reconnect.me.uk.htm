                    <p><b>Marion Winslow</b></p>

                    <p>Hi. You have reached the first version of my website. I hope to replace this shortly by a more developed and differentiated version. In this I give you an introduction to my background, my professional position and nature of my work.</p>

                    <p>I am qualified as an Integrative Body Psychotherapist through the Chiron Centre for Integrative Body Psychotherapy based in West London. Through this training I am also qualified in Biodynamic Massage. I am Accredited with the UKCP (United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy) and am a Member of the BACP (British Associaton for Counselling and Psychtherapy). At the end of this page there are further details of qualifications relevant to my work.</p>

                    <p>I offer psychotherapy, counselling, and massage from short- to long-term, primarily for individuals. My experience has included working in a bereavement counselling setting for two years and working with private clients at home and in West London from a range of backgrounds with varying issues.</p>

                    <h2>My Approach</h2>

                    <p>The kind of counselling and psychotherapy I offer is broad-based. The UKCP Section to which I belong is the Humanistic Section. A description of the principles we adhere to in the Humanistic section the largest in the UKCP - can be obtained from the UKCP website.</p>

                    <p>Everyone brings a unique set of questions, problems, strengths and experiences to counselling and psychotherapy. Therefore the way in which it is appropriate to work with each individual will differ significantly. Initially in most but not all cases, I work with open exploration in which there is a chance for you to find a space that is all your own to look at and explore and address the issues that concern you.</p>

                    <p>The title Body Psychotherapist refers first and foremost to the fact that a full level of experience must include the experience of the body, and in our often over-intellectualized culture this is not recognized. Our body mirrors and reflects all that is happening on other levels within us. The feeling and recognition of our emotions and our perceptions goes through and with the body; but in an effort to control our experience, we often shut down in various ways. A body psychotherapist is attuned to draw attention to and to take note of the way you may respond on different levels especially through the body and to help you develop bodily somatic awareness. This is a route to becoming or feeling more fully here in your life. At times and for some people it can be a slow and difficult process. Bodily or somatic symptoms and health problems may hold psychological and emotional meaning, which you may already be partially aware of.</p>

                    <p>With some clients, it may be helpful and appropriate to use touch in the sessions. Occasionally this may take the form of periods of biodynamic massage, which can release deeply held tensions in various ways. Massage is also available separately, including as an adjunct for a client who is in psychotherapy elsewhere. Another form in which the body can engage is through movement.</p>

                    <p>At some point in the experience, it may be that I will suggest and work with structured exercises or homework, assuming you, the client, are happy with this. These may be of various kinds, especially relaxation and meditation exercises. There is often a lot of similarity between the activities of meditation and psychotherapy: meditation uses techniques and attitudes that allow us to find a centre from which to look at all the manifold experiences of our lives, and, by broadening our awareness and developing our centre-ing, make choices, decisions, and develop our awareness in tune with our real needs. Psychotherapy operates in a comparable way with the crucial difference that another person is involved. Writing or other expressive and artistic activities can also be important to the process of developing awareness, self-integration and expression.</p>

                    <p>In longer-term psychotherapy, the relationship between myself as therapist and you as client becomes an important part of the therapy experience, giving us insight and information and potentially new experiences that your mind and psyche can work with. Where there is significant childhood emotional damage in your history, this aspect will be particularly important</p>

                    <h2>My Background</h2>

                    <p>I came to train as a psychotherapist and counsellor through an early interest in the mental health field, and also through my interest in philosophy and spirituality - the nature of the human mind and our experience in the world and all those big questions! I had a variety of jobs in my early adult life including as a research assistant in sociology, and then spent many years working with children in one way or another. I had a very positive experience of my own with therapists trained in the body psychotherapy tradition which led me in this direction. I started training in counselling in 1996 and within a couple of years had started part-time training at the Chiron Centre.</p>

                    <p>In addition to individual work I run a practice/training group in Nonviolent Communication (NVC). I have been involved in NVC groups for some time now. It offers a structure for understanding and empathising with oneself and with others expecially geared at conflict resolution, based around an understanding of the human needs that we are all trying to meet.</p>

                    <p>I have also trained with a body named the Interfaith Seminary which offers support to those who wish to create personalized ceremonies and rituals to meet their particular needs and beliefs.</p>
